# Wine_models
This is an analysis of BlueBerry Winery dataset to predict the type and quality of wines using Machin Lerning techniques imploying Sklearn.
The name of Directories are informative:

Wine_type directory includes the models for predicting the type of wines

Wine_quality has the models for predicting the quality of wines

In the subdirectories:

No_resampling (or SMOTETOMEK or SMOTE) refers to method of resampling.

Recursive Feature elimination (or Anova or Feature_importance) indicates the method of Feature selection.

Grid_search (or random search or Bayesian search) refers to the search method.

The estimate of pricing of wines based on a dataset of wine_sales_data.csv which includes the price of wines in different counteries is also included (in wine_pricing directory). The mse of ML for prediction of price is ~6 and model needs improvement (This is in my list of 'to do').
